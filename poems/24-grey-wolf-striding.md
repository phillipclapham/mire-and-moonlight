# xxiv

grey wolf striding
silent
among the trees

stalking prey
to feed hungry cubs

the forest indifferent
to her bounty

tiny bird
broken wing

forest floor
now
prison
home

falling snow
covers bones—
the orange fox's last kill

in his den
he rests content

tomorrow he must stain
the fresh snow
red

reeds once swayed
on the banks of this river

wolf, bird, and fox
swept away
in the dark

now mushrooms
grow beside the puddles
still left behind
