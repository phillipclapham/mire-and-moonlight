# Mire and Moonlight

*some flowers only blossom in mire and moonlight*

---

A curated collection of 34 poems written from radical presence—not about enlightenment, but from what remains after the self dissolves.

## About the Author

**Phill Clapham** — poet, engineer, mad scientist.

By day, a Senior Solutions Architect building enterprise systems. By night, building the missing layer between humans and AI through [Protocol Memory](https://protocolmemory.com) and [FlowScript](https://github.com/phillipclapham).

The poetry and the infrastructure come from the same place: a brain that runs on fascination, not discipline. Wu wei (無為)—effortless action, natural flow—isn't philosophy here. It's operating system.

A health crisis in 2020 (mast cell disease, still being classified) made everything urgent. The methodology that emerged—[RAYGUN OS](https://raygunos.com)—keeps me functional while managing serious constraints. These poems are part of that substrate: explorations of presence written during the same years I was building cognitive infrastructure for human-AI partnership.

## Why Open Release

This work is released freely because poetry, like methodology, should flow without gatekeepers.

Traditional publishing optimizes for prestige and scarcity. Open release optimizes for reach and use. Take these words. Remix them. Quote them. Let them spread. The value is in the resonance, not the control.

## The Voice

These poems arise from direct observation, not conceptual thinking. Core principles:

- **Radical presence** — poems from what is, not what's remembered or planned
- **Wu wei** — allowing poems to emerge rather than constructing them
- **Weightless depth** — profound insights that land soft as snowfall
- **Extreme compression** — every word must justify its existence
- **Trust the image** — no explaining, no metaphor-making
- **Present tense immediacy** — eternal now, even when noting change
- **Line breaks as meaning** — creating surprise or multiple readings
- **White space as text** — silence speaks
- **Endings that dissolve** — reframe rather than resolve

What I avoid: temporal markers that pin things to sequential time, explaining causation between images, the remembering/planning self, abstract words when concrete ones exist, decorative language.

The philosophy behind this work: *"All is true is false is meaningful is meaningless is all is nothing—simultaneously."*

## Reading

The poems are numbered with Roman numerals (0 through xlvi, with gaps from curation) and can be read in sequence or browsed individually. Start anywhere. Some will resonate, some won't. That's how it works.

A few entry points:
- [0 (unnamed unborn)](poems/00-unnamed-unborn.md) — the opening, wu wei distilled
- [vi (beside a green pond)](poems/06-beside-a-green-pond.md) — three lines, complete
- [xvi (still pond)](poems/16-still-pond.md) — reflection dissolving
- [xxx (dark graveyard)](poems/30-dark-graveyard.md) — where the title comes from
